This is a simple rails recipe sharing app I built based on a <a href="https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/3/>tutorial</a> geared toward learning to use the Paperclip Gem with Heroku and Amazon S3.

My implementation is available here: https://recipist.herokuapp.com/

(Heroku may take a moment to come to life.)
